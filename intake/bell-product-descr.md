# City of Spokane Data Management and Analytics System

## Background
The City of Spokane’s SW Department is a vertically integrated collection and disposal system. The Department has been operating at a financial deficit for the last two years and faces regulatory headwinds as Washington state mandates will increase the cost of service in the upcoming years. Uncontrollable costs such as insurance and asset replacement are also putting significant pressure on rates. Raising collection rates commensurate with the increased expenses is not a long-term solution. The Department requires a financial strategy to maintain service delivery and prudently manage operational costs.

## Need for Data Management and Analytics
The Solid Waste Director and his management team need reliable information to implement and execute the department’s financial strategy. An Excel rate model that is updated annually during the budget season is not a solution. Integrating the nexus of data from the department and the City’s disparate systems into an integrated solution that provides managers with the information necessary to control costs while maintaining the delivery of services. The Department needs a centralized, scalable, cloud-based financial and performance platform for planning, tracking, and reporting on budgets/expenses, revenue adequacy (rates), strategic priorities, and key performance measures. The platform would integrate the following types of data:

1.	General ledger / financial
2.	Billing
3.	Routing 
4.	Payroll
5.	Collection Telemetrics
6.	Scalehouse

The assumption is that data integration would occur with a human-in-the-loop, whereby aggregated data from those 6 systems would be exported from each system and imported to this product, using defined schemas.

## Key features
Some of the key features of the product should include:

**Easy Data Entry**: Key platform data can be imported to the system by City staff on a monthly basis using intuitive, user-friendly interfaces.

**Dashboards**: Management dashboards should provide insights on all platform data, particularly financial reporting by function (collection, disposal, etc.) and rate reporting. Dashboards should also allow tracking of data imports and import status.

**Data Export**: Customizable data querying and export capability into multiple formats (Excel, Word, PowerPoint, PDF).
