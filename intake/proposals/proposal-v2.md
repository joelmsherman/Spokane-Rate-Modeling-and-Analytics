# Spokane Solid Waste Rate Analytics Platform
## Budget-Constrained Option

**Prepared for:** Bell & Associates / City of Spokane Solid Waste Division
**Prepared by:** JMS Analytics
**Date:** October 31, 2025

## Executive Summary

The original full-build proposal estimated $141,000-$186,000 in professional services to deliver a complete cloud-based analytics platform. With a budget constraint of $40,000, a full implementation is not feasible. However, I recommend that the City invest in developing detailed requirements and design mocks that will pave the way for the platform described in my previous proposal.
