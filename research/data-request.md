# City of Spokane Solid Waste Data Request - DRAFT!!!!!

This document proposes some datasets for supporting the Phase 2 analysis. It is assumed that **City staff will extract and prepare these datasets** from City application systems, spreadsheets and other sources, then upload them to the data platform constructed in Phase 1. The platform will validate, parse and store the data in a relational database ready for cross-entity analysis. 

As new data becomes available for each dataset over time, staff can upload the new data to the system. In this way, the database can serve as a single-source-of-truth for City analytics needs rate and cost-of-service analysis over time.

## 1. Expenses Dataset

### Purpose
Foundation for revenue requirement analysis and cost allocation to lines of business (disposal, cart collection, container collection, roll-off) and cost components (labor, equipment, facility, administrative, taxes/fees).

### Time Period
- **Historical Data:** 3 fiscal years (FY2022, FY2023, FY2024)
- **Current Year:** FY2025 YTD actuals + remainder of year budget
- **Projected Year:** FY2026 full-year budget (if available)

### Granularity
**Annual by account/cost center** - One row per fiscal year, per account

### Dataset Structure

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `fiscal_year` | Fiscal year | 2024 |
| `is_completed` | Whether (1) or not (0) entry from completed fiscal year | 1 |
| `fund_code` | Fund identifier | 4100 |
| `fund_name` | Fund description | Solid Waste Operating |
| `cost_center_code` | Department/cost center code | 45100 |

### Notes
- Include interfund transfers as separate line items
- Include debt service payments (principal and interest)
- Exclude depreciation if tracked separately in asset data
- `is_completed` separates partial current year, and projected next year data from actuals

## 2. Revenue / Billing

### Purpose
Determine current revenue generated by each service type and customer class for comparison against cost of service. Calculate revenue per customer for rate adequacy analysis.

### Time Period
- **Historical:** 3 fiscal years (FY2022, FY2023, FY2024)

### Granularity
**Monthly by service type and rate class** - One row per month, per service/rate combination

### Dataset Structure

| Field | Description | Example |

| `service_type` | Type of service | Garbage, Yard Debris, Recycling |
| `rate_class` | Rate schedule category | 60-gallon cart, 2-yard dumpster |
| `pickups_per_week` | Number of pickups per week (commercial only; leave blank for residential) | 1, 2, 3, etc. |
| `billed_amount` | Total revenue billed | 1,031,044.28 |

### Notes
- Include any miscellaneous fees (cart delivery, extra pickups, etc.)
- If exact customer counts aren't available monthly, provide counts at fiscal year end

## 3. Customer Counts

### Purpose
Denominators for calculating unit costs (cost per customer, cost per container, etc.). Supports allocation of costs across rate classes.

### Time Period
- **Historical:** End of each fiscal year (FY2022, FY2023, FY2024)
- **Current:** Most recent month available

### Granularity
**Point-in-time snapshot by service level** - Customer counts at end of each fiscal year

### Dataset Structure

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `snapshot_date` | Date of count | 2024-06-30 |
| `customer_class` | Residential or Commercial | Residential |

| `rate_class` | Rate schedule category | 60-gallon cart, 2-yard dumpster |
| `pickups_per_week` | Number of pickups per week (commercial only; leave blank for residential) | 1, 2, 3, etc. |
| `active_customers` | Count of active accounts | 31,245 |

### Notes
- If customer counts come from billing system, this may overlap with billing data

## 4. Tonnage

### Time Period
- **Historical:** 3 fiscal years (FY2022, FY2023, FY2024)
- **Current:** FY2025 YTD

### Granularity
**Monthly by material type and source** - One row per month, per material, per source

| `source_type` | Origin of material | Residential Collection, Commercial Collection, Self-Haul |
| `tons` | Total tons received | 5,243.7 |
| `transaction_count` | Number of scale tickets | 1,847 |

### Notes
- Separate City route waste from self-haul public customers
- If recycling and HHW weights are available from public drop-off include those

## 5. Labor

### Purpose
Allocate personnel costs to lines of business and cost components. Labor is typically the largest expense category and requires careful allocation.

### Time Period
- **Historical:** 3 fiscal years (FY2022, FY2023, FY2024)
- **Current:** FY2025 YTD

### Granularity
**Annual by position/function** - One row per fiscal year, per job classification

### Dataset Structure

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `fiscal_year` | Fiscal year | 2024 |
| `department` | Department name | Solid Waste - Collection |
| `job_classification` | Position title/class | Driver II |

| `total_compensation` | Total personnel cost | 1,005,700.00 |

### Notes
- If benefits are calculated as a percentage, provide the rate used

- If employees split time across functions, allocate FTEs accordingly
- If monthly or pay-period detail is easier to extract, that works too.

## 6. Assets / Equipment

### Purpose

- **Current:** Most recent available

### Granularity
**Asset inventory snapshot per fiscal year** - One row per fiscal year, per asset or asset class

For individual assets (trucks), one row per vehicle. For bulk assets (carts), can aggregate by type/size.

### Dataset Structure

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `fiscal_year` | Fiscal year of snapshot | 2024 |
| `asset_id` | Unique identifier | VEH-2019-045 |

- Include facilities (WTE plant, maintenance yard, admin buildings)
- If detailed fleet maintenance costs are available, they can supplement this data

## 7. Truck Maintenance

### Purpose
Allocate vehicle operating costs to collection services. Supports fleet cost component in rate model.

### Time Period
- **Historical:** 2 fiscal years (FY2023, FY2024)
- **Current:** FY2025 YTD

### Granularity
**Monthly by vehicle or vehicle class** - One row per month, per vehicle (or aggregated by vehicle type)

### Dataset Structure

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `month` | Month of expense | 2024-03 |
